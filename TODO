TODO:

 #1 The KonqBookmarkView delegate is not being triggered for some reason when
   trying to edit an item.
    
 #2 I've needed to add a disableRevisionCheck() call to the update of items in
   EntityTreeModel because it would otherwise it wouldn't work.
   
 #3 Access always directly to Nepomuk in konqbookmark. NOT
 
 #4 Nepomuk needs to be able to get resource updates from other processes so that
    our process' cache doesn't get outdated. See ResourceManager::resourceModified
    TODO.

 #5 Fix drag and drop in bookmarksView.
 
 #6 Wait for EntityTreeView to get out of akonadi_next and into kdepimlibs.
 
 #7 Segfaults with EntityTreeModel.
 
 #8 Convert KonqBookmark to Awesome::Place or similar? We need to make something
    more flexible which will allow others use it outside konqueror.
 
 #9 Fix bookmarks menu.


Planning:
 Fix #1, create own model
 
 * Nepomuk is used by the wrapper class KonqBookmark for accessing to the data.
 * Akonadi is used to administrate collections and virtual collections and to allow
 in the future adding new types of bookmarks and bookmark sources in an easy way.
 * The Akonadi resource is mostly decoupled from KonqBookmark (not completely but 
 that can be done later), so it's reusable. Ideally the akonadi resource should
 only deal with Nepomuk::Resource.
 
 
 * How to automatically expand tree
 * How to store the items order in collections

  * Nepomuk resourcedata ache syncing between different processes
  * Integrate Nepomuk and Akonadi
  * How to store in Nepomuk the number of Visits of each bookmark
