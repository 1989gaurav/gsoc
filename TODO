   EntityTreeModel because it would otherwise it wouldn't work.

 * Nepomuk is used by the wrapper class KonqBookmark for accessing to the data.
 * Akonadi is used to administrate collections and virtual collections and to allow
 in the future adding new types of bookmarks and bookmark sources in an easy way.
 * The Akonadi resource is mostly decoupled from KonqBookmark (not completely but 
 that can be done later), so it's reusable. Ideally the akonadi resource should
 only deal with Nepomuk::Resource.
