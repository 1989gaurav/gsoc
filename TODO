Present bugs:

 * The KonqBookmarkView delegate is not being triggered for some reason when
   trying to edit an item.
    
 * I've needed to add a disableRevisionCheck() call to the update of items in
   EntityTreeModel because it would otherwise it wouldn't work.
   
 * When an item or a folder is added or removed, the KonqBookmarkView doesn't
   get updated.
