Present bugs:

 #1 The KonqBookmarkView delegate is not being triggered for some reason when
   trying to edit an item.
    
 #2 I've needed to add a disableRevisionCheck() call to the update of items in
   EntityTreeModel because it would otherwise it wouldn't work.
   
Planning:
 Fix #1 and #3, create own model
