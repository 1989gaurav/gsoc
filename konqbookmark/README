How To Build
-=-=-=-=-=-=

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull ..      <- do not forget the ..
make
make install or su -c 'make install'

where $KDEDIR needs to be set to your KDE installation prefix.

to uninstall the project:
make uninstall or su -c 'make uninstall'

Note: you can use another build path. Then cd in your build dir and:
export KDE_SRC=path_to_your_src
cmake $KDE_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull


Implementation hints
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The code generated by this template can be compiled without any further
changes, so you can start with your own code right away.

However, there are a couple of things you will need to change outside the
serialzer's code, i.e. in the serializer's .desktop file:

- Name field

- Comment field

- Type field: MIME type of your data type
