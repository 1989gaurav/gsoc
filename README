Konqueror Bookmarks
-------------------

This document outlines how the new bookmarks system is architected. This is a
project to replace the current bookmarks system in konqueror. It's divided in
several folders:

 * ontologies - Library which contains the C++ classes for the Nepomuk
   ontologies used in this project. It's separated so that other modules of the
   bookmarks system can dynamically link to it.

 * konqbookmark - The core of the bookmark system. It contains main classes like
   KonqBookmark, Place, LocationBar, some useful item views and models, etc.
   
 * konquerorbookmarks - The akonadi bookmarks resource, a middle layer to access
   the bookmarks which are actually stored in Nepomuk.
   
 * bookmarks_editor - As it name says, it's the Konqueror Bookmarks Editor
   implementation.
   
 * nepotest - a test program used for development purposes, not very useful.

Architecture
------------

Nepomuk ----> Akonadi ----> You

Bookmarks are stored in Nepomuk database as NFO Bookmarks and BookmarkFolders.
But you don't really access to bookmarks directly with Nepomuk, but with Akonadi
instead. The Akonadi resource's job is to present the user the collection of 
bookmarks and to let the user modify them.
